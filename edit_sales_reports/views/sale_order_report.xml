                            Payment will be made as agreed in writing by Metra or in absence of such agreement, the payment is due immediately, without further notice from Metra. Payment timing is of the essence. Metra may suspend deliveries or service until full payment for that order. In case of delay in payment, Metra and the Customer agree that the Customer shall pay Metra liquidated damages in an amount equivalent to 2% monthly accruing on a day-to-day basis for each day of late payment (unless we otherwise elect) on the overdue amount, and the costs of recovery shall be payable by the Customer. 
The Customer agrees that all invoices and any other amounts due under this agreement are payable solely to us in the currency of payment stated above, in full without any set off, counter-claims, abatement, or reduction. We may at our sole discretion apply payments made to us (whether by the Customer or otherwise) to pay late payment charges, invoices overdue interest, or any outstanding amounts. The Customer must pay all sums due to us under this agreement, including invoices and other charges in full, without abatement, discount, reduction, set off, dispute or counterclaim. The Customer will not assert against Metra any claims the Customer may have against any third party including the manufacturer or original supplier or shipper of the Products. We have no obligation to perform any obligation by any third party. Metra may set off against any amounts owed by Metra to the Customer any amounts due from the Customer to Metra (including those prospectively or contingently due where in our reasonable opinion they are likely to become payable). 
Metra may at any time and at its sole discretion cancel a Customer’s credit line. In case of cancellation of the credit line, all invoices become immediately due.
Advance payments are due on the contract date and are non-refundable. Metra reserves the right to settle advance payments against any other due amounts, including but not limited to finance charges, holding fees or any other dues.
If the Customer is purchasing the Products from Metra’s subsidiary in Egypt (Metra Computers S.A.E) it shall have the right to select the currency in which the order shall be paid, hereinafter referred to as the “payment currency”, at the time of receiving the quotation from Metra. Metra shall have the right to give different prices depending on the payment currency. If a Customer selects payment in a foreign currency (not Egyptian Pounds), then the Customer must pay in the foreign currency as specified in the contract of sale. If a Customer selects payment in local currency (Egyptian Pounds), then Customer must pay at the higher of, the rate declared by the Central Bank of Egypt or any local Egyptian bank on the date of payment or due date of invoice (whichever is higher).

Accordingly, the Customer is responsible for ensuring that the End-User receives the entire financial benefit of the discount reflected in Metra’s offer. Metra will provide an Estimated End User Price (“EEP”) which will be Metra’s estimate of the highest price that End-User could pay while also receiving the entire benefit of the discount. While the Customer has the exclusive right to determine their own sales prices for Metra’s Products(s), the Customer must comply with the foregoing obligation to pass down the financial benefit of the discount to the End-User.

                            The Delivery period in the Order confirmation is approximate and based solely on estimates. Any failure to comply with such dates shall not constitute a breach of contract by Metra. If no dates are specified, delivery will occur within a reasonable timeframe, considering the standard delivery duration for those specific Products from the manufacturer concerned. Handover of Products will take place within a reasonable timeframe following their delivery from the manufacturer, accounting for the typical duration required for arranging and executing shipping to the designated handover location, as well as completing any necessary formalities. Metra shall not be liable for any delays in delivery caused by the manufacturer of the Products. 
Partial deliveries may be made. The place of delivery is stated in the Order confirmation. Title to Products passes on full payment and until then the Customer must insure the Products and the Customer must not modify or pledge them. The Customer may use the Products, without modification, in the ordinary course of business. Metra reserves the rights to enter the storage premises to repossess the Products. If the Customer sells them before title passes, the Customer will become Metra's agent and the proceeds of such sale shall be held on Metra's behalf separately from the Customer's general funds. Metra may sue for the Price before title passes. All risk of the loss of the Products passes to the Customer upon delivery. 
The Customer acknowledges and understands that any of Metra’s affiliates or subsidiaries may provide the Customer with the Products.
Upon receiving the Products, the Customer or the Ship-to party must sign the delivery note. Any missing or damaged packaging should be noted on the delivery note prior to signing it by the Customer or the Ship-to party. Metra shall be entitled to assume that any person who both reasonably appears and claims to have authority to accept delivery who signs a note in respect of the Products on behalf of the Customer or the End-User (if Metra has agreed to deliver direct) does in fact have the authority.
Customer understands and agrees that Metra may accept an order therefrom but such order might not be released for delivery if the Customer has any debts or overdue payments to Metra. It is the Customer’s responsibility to ensure that it is within credit limit and has no overdue invoices in order for an order to be released for delivery by Metra.
The Customer undertakes not to sell the Products purchased from Metra to any party other than the End-user intended and previously declared to Metra.
